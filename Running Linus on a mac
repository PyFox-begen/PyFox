Running Linus on a mac

Mac minis or any kind of macs can run Linus and can even be installed as a prime os
but not all work the ones that work of me where pop os, Linux Mint, Lubuntu and Zorin OS

but apple will try to stop you and you may avode your worenty but if you have a old mac that you want to run linux you can but it will take some time and my not work

i nearly lost one fully by del the bios and having to reinstall it

and i have nothing to do if you end up braking your mac along the way so if you do DONT DM ME OR TELL ME ABOUT IT!!! but if you have any qestons ask me
